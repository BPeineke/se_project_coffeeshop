## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

The README.md file contains:

1. The project’s name
2. A description of the project and its functionality
3. A description of the technologies and techniques used
4. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features (highly
   recommended)

A title.
Any notes on recent updates to the codebase.
A description of the project. Write about its features and functionality, why you made it, and what problem it should address. Here, you can mention all of the technologies you used while doing your project, especially if you used several technologies at once.
Include pictures, gifs, or screenshots that explain the project features.
Instructions on deployment and system requirements (anything one would need to use the code).
Plans for improving the project, if any. Not just "Refactor code," but "Fix X using Y to achieve Z.” The more details, the better.
When your README.md is done, you just need to push it to GitHub. After that, people will see it on your repository page!
