## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

This project highlights the diverse uses of flexbox as a display manipulation and alteration tool.
The layout and content is created and integrated through targeted and systematic application of various means of positioning. By rendering a vibrant and interactive page the project showcases the power of css to create content that is appealing both visually and interactively through its displays and transformations.
The layout and animations drive interactivity with the user and create an ultimately “sticky” page.
